# SFL - XLand-MiniGrid 

Fork of [XLand-MiniGrid](https://github.com/corl-team/xland-minigrid) for "No Regrets: Investigating and Improving Regret
Approximations for Curriculum Discovery". This repository is seperate from the [main paper repository](https://github.com/amacrutherford/sampling-for-learnability) due to XLand having a different JAX version from JaxNav and JaxUED's Minigrid.

## Installation

We include a Dockerfile which can be built with `make build` and run with `make run`.

## Running experiments

All training scripts are located within `training`. Experiments can be easily run with `wandb` sweeps, with example configuration files located within `sweeps`. We include a helpful script for easily starting sweeps, `start_wandb_sweep.py`. Using it, our sfl result can be recreated as:

```
python start_wandb_sweep.py sweeps/sfl_seeds.yaml 0:3 1
```

## CVaR Evaluation

Code for our robust evaluation is located within `eval`.
